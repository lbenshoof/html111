		<p> Created in early 80’s as a form of street dance associated with hip hop music. Several different types have emerged since the earliest complex forms of breakdancing, popping, and locking.
There are more simpler forms of hip hop since it has started that are easier to grasp for the most novice student and can even be choreographed with pop music. You get to add in your own personality and style. 
There can be a fusion of jazz hip hop, like the kind you may see in pop music videos- what people in the dance community calls a “watered-down” version of hip hop. 
Hip hop entails more bounce at the knees and contraction of the abdominal muscles. It can be simple to complex, but it must be personalized with your style! </p>
