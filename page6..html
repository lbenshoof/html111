		Developed in the 19th century, but gained widespread popularity in the U.S. during the 20th century- A highly expressive style of dance where feeling and improvisation is the main focus instead of a focus of rigid structure and posture, as with the ballet. Modern dance is a style where you can move freely as you go and simply expressing yourself without any rules. In fact, it was invented as a rebellion again ballet, which has structure, discipline, and focuses on such.  Of course, it can be choreographed, but just by looking at choreography sometimes it looks almost as if it is a bit clumsy at times and unrealistic moves. 
The moves and techniques learned in Modern Dance can be helpful in Hip Hop because you use a lot of contraction with your abs and roll of the spine as with a lot of Hip Hop bouncing moves.
There are 5 types of Modern Dance: 1. Graham (named after teacher Martha Graham) 2. Limon (named after teacher Jose Limon) 3. Release Technique ( focus on anatomical consideration, breathing, muscle relaxation, gravity and momentum to carry your body through certain dance moves) 4. Improvisation (no set choreography, but to dance fluidly and do what comes to mind as you go) 5. Contact improvisation (the exploration of oneâ€™s body in relationship to others by using the fundamentals of touch, sharing weight, and movement awareness). </p>
