			<p> Dating further back than tap, jazz, modern, and hip hop, ballet dates back to the 15th/16th century during the Italian Renaissance before spreading to France. In fact, all ballet dance moves have french names. 
			Ballet is the foundation of all dance. Most forms of dance performed has some element of ballet even if it is just simply pointing of the toe. Ballet is rigid, structured, and precise. It improves posture, muscle, agility, flexibility and sensory motor performance. Ballet is very useful and helpful when trying to learn other forms of dance and some sports. </p>
